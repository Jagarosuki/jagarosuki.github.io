[{"content":" Fig 1. N4BP1 Structure: Schematic-structural Representation of N4BP1 Structure using Mouse and Human domain boundaries from Kliza \u0026 Song et al. - with the latter in brackets - indicated using amino acid residues. N4BP1 domain structures used in the schematic were generated using AlphaFold 3; KH (pTM=0.86), UBM (pTM=0.39), UBA (pTM=0.76), RNase (pTM=0.94) , CUE (pTM=0.78). Background What is N4BP1? N4BP1 (NEDD4 Binding Protein 1) is a dimerisation-dependent linear ubiquitin reader [2], which recognises M1-linked (linear) ubiquitin (Ub) chains. It has been shown that N4BP1 negatively regulates the TNFR signalling pathway by competing with RIP1 and NEMO in selectively binding to linear Ub chains, or alternatively, preventing linear ubiquitination of LUBAC substrates [3],[4]. N4BP1 is composed of five domains (Fig. 1), with the distal three domains, the divergent UBA (UB associated), NYN RNase and divergent CUE domain implicated in being responsible for linear Ub specificity [2].\nRecent Developments A recent x-ray crystallography study by Gitlin et al.[5], obtained a crystal structure for the CUE domain of N4BP1 in complex with M1-linked diUB (PDB: 8t48), placing the CUE domain centrally between the distal and proximal UB. The model produced by Kliza et al. using chemical shift perturbation values places the CUE domain in the same region, but rotated horizontally approximately ∼90◦ about the terminal α3-helix (Fig. 2).\nFig 2. Proposed modes of CUE-Ub binding: Zoomed in structure at bottom of both figures showing key interacting residues in both structures. LEU8, ILE44, VAL70 Canonical “hydrophobic patch” and hydrophobic interfacing residues shown in magenta and purple respectively. Interacting hydrogen-bonding (non-backbone) residues shown in dark green. A Dimerisation-dependent CUE binding model from Kliza et al. B X-ray crystal structure of CUE-diUb obtained by Gitlin et al. (PDB: 8t48) While both models have a conformation of the CUE domain which facilitates interfacing of the ”canonical” Ubiquitin LEU8, ILE44, VAL70 hydrophobic patch, it is notable is that PRO863 is interfacing with the patch in the dimerisation model (Fig. 3C), but not in the crystal structure. is also quite a high energy salt bridge present in the crystal structure between Ub-ARG42 and CUE-ASP893 (Fig. 2B, bottom). It has been previously noted that salt bridges can aid conformational specificity, particularly between secondary structures [6]. One diﬀerence between the two structures that can easily go unnoticed, is the torsion angle of the distal Ub which is diﬀerent in both structures. By analysing the conservation of the N4BP1 CUE domain across 221 diﬀerent species, we can conclude which CUE-Ub binding model is most likely to exist in vivo, but also suggest how it might be possible to detect other domains that might bind in-between a proximal and distal ubiquitin via the canonical hydrophobic patch.\nInvestigation Results Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) analysis of conserved CUE binding motifs MSA analysis of the N4BP1 CUE domains of 221 diﬀerent species showed areas of 100% conservation, the most notable of which being residues 883-889 (Fig. 3D/G) - the α3-helix - and the 861-862, IF motif (Fig. 3A/G) which has also been noted previously [3]. PRO863 was also highly conserved as it likely functions as a helix break for the α1-helix. It should be noted that, while not present in Fig. 3, LEU890 and V AL891 do not have a 100% conservation rate, and that in the case of LEU890, Human and Mouse N4BP1 represents the minority of sequences (10.41%) that contain leucine as opposed to methionine (89.59%). The QRS (845-457) motif at the start of CUE domain is exhibited in 99.55% of the sequences in the alignment.\nFig 3.

H Alignment of other related CUE domains. Sequence is highlighted blue based of percentage identity of shared residues. Apart from these three main areas, the α3-helix, the the IF motif + PRO863, and the QRS motif at the start of the CUE domain, there are many sequences that are divergent from the consensus particularly around the α1-helix \u0026amp; α2-helix.\nDiscussion MSA shows Crystal Structure to be more likely in vivo This report would argue that the highly conserved nature of ALA889 and ALA886 (Fig. 3D) is extremely strong evidence in favour of the crystal structure from Gitlin et al. being true in vivo. In the sequence alignment, these residues displayed 100% conservation. When looking at a space filling representation of these alanine residues in the crystal structure (Fig. 3E) it becomes obvious that if these residues were spatially any larger they would interfere with the hydrophobic binding interface. In the model by Kliza et al., these residues are pointing out (Fig. 3F) and could very much be substituted with another residue with a high helix-propensity to maintain the secondary structure. Thus this is why no such substitutions are present in the sequence alignment. Considering other regions of the sequence alignment are not so highly conserved, it should not be an issue of insuﬃcient sequence data. If we look further into the sequence alignment data, it can be seen that all the residues interfacing with the LEU8, ILE44, VAL70, hydrophobic patch (Fig. B) in the crystal structure are all highly conserved (100%). While this is technically true of the interfacing residues in the model by Kliza et al. There is much less coverage of the hydrophobic patch by interfacing residues (Fig. 3C), and some of those residue responsible for interfacing in the crystal structure could theoretically be mutated without impacting the binding surface; SER888 particularly comes to mind as a candidate for alanine mutagenesis to prove the binding interface as it is interfacing in the crystal structure but not the model.\nConservation of negatively charged residues at aa864/866 NMR titration data from Song 2020, showed that lysine-K48 on Ubiquitin, when titrated with the N4BP1 CUE domain, exhibits quite a large chemical shift. Considering that the LYS48 is not part of the binding interaction in the crystal structure, it must be involved as part of transition state where the CUE domain is guided to the hydrophobic patch. Previous research has shown that CUE domain has extremely low binding aﬃnity to K48A ubiquitin mutant [3],[2],[9]. This report would suggest that either ASP864 or GLU866 would be good candidates for site-directed mutagenesis to determine which residues are involved in forming a transition state with LYS48. Both of these residues, point in the direction of LYS48 in the crystal structure, and any one of them might serve as a potential axis of rotation to place the CUE domain into the hydrophobic patch. Further exploration of this transition state would be of interest as this mechanism could also lead to the inhibition of LYS48 polyubiquitination.\nα3-helix is much lighter on average compared to other CUE/CUBAN domains As data from the MSA has shown, the conservation of the characteristics of the terminal α3-helix - that being mainly its small size - are crucially important for the N4BP1 CUE domain to be able to bind to M1-linked Ub. If the terminal α3-helix were any larger, it would simply not fit, and disrupt the interaction on the hydrophobic patch. Table 1 shows the average molecular weight of an amino acid in any of the three helices present some other related CUE/CUBAN domains.\nProtein Domain α1-helix α2-helix α3-helix PDB N4BP1_Mouse CUE 111.4 112.1 101.5 8t48 CUE2_Yeast CUE 118.5 119.4 107.8 1otr KHNYN_Human CUBAN 133.9 128.4 116.5 2n5m ASCC2_Human CUE 108.6 114.8 116.7 2di0 TOLLIP_Human CUE 119.6 114.3 107.2 1wgl VPS9_Yeast CUE 119.7 110.3 110.3 1mn3 Table 1: Average molecular weights of amino acid residues in the helices of CUE/CUBAN domains As you can see, the α3-helix in the N4BP1 CUE domain is the lightest of them all by a nominal margin. This suggests it might be possible to detect which region of a domain is most likely to interact with the basal region between two M1-linked ubiquitin. Since due to steric hinderances, it is not possible to have helices that are any larger than the CUE α3-helix. Structures could potentially be filtered by this quality, to be identified as candidates for binding to M1-linked ubiquitin.\nConclusion The CUE domain of N4BP1 has a highly conserved binding mode that facilitates an interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues by placing its small α3-helix in the basal region of the M1-linkage. This is what allows it to form not only favourable hydrophobic interactions with the ubiquitin hydrophobic patch, but also forms a stabilising salt-bridge between Ub-ARG42 and CUE-ASP893. The results from the MSA are consistent with what would be expected by the conservation of important regions present in the crystal structure obtained by Gitlin et al. Next steps would be to see if there are further interactions via other N4BP1 domains and how a transition state might form around LYS48. It will be interesting to see how research around N4BP1 develps, especially as to whether further oligomerization of the RNase domain might be possible beyond a dimer [2] and the potential implications that come when binding to large poly-ubiquitin chains.\nMethods Multiple sequence alignments MSAs obtained using BLAST[10] and MUSCLE[11]. Some low coverage/occupancy sequences such as those used in Fig. 3H had to be aligned by hand based oﬀ alignments from Song 2020. Sequences were obtained by running a BLAST of the Mouse N4BP1 CUE domain 845-893 with 1000 max target sequences, expect threshold 0.05, word size 5, scoring matrix BLOSUM62. Top 300 non-isoform N4BP1 sequences were selected to be manually refined and processed using MSA. ALVIS[8] and Jalview[12] were used to produce Figure 3 and view MSAs.\nStructure prediction \u0026amp; protein visualisation AlphaFold 3[1] web-server was used to predict N4BP1 structure. Full length Mouse N4BP1 was sent for struture prediction, as well as each individual domain using domain boundaries from Kliza et al.
